## Design

The design of all the characters was created by the wonderfully talented Julia Yin, who can be found at twitter.com/JayJinXi, instagram.com/littlesnowjj/, twitch.tv/jayjamy, facebook.com/littlesnowjj.3

Three sprites were created for the enemies, these were randomly choosen when the enemy was spawned.
Similarly the bullets have four different sprites which are randomly chosen from when fired.
